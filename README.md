Analyze movie sentiment using Deep Learning Models ( iMBD Dataset)


# Final Observations
The LSTM's and GRU's almost provided the same performance, but GRU's are used as it is faster to train compared to LSTMS's

F-1 Score of 75% was recorded on the test data. This can be further improved by having more data for training the model, so more words can be analyzed to predict the sentiment

Because of the forget and control gates in LSTM and GRU, the models performed well compared to the Vanilla RNN which consideres the context of the entire input length of the data
